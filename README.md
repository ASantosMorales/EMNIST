# EMNIST
First attemp to read handwritten numbers and letters using the EMNIST (Extension of the well known MNIST dataset https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/emnist-dataset ).

1. Reading of dataset.
The Matlab-format-dataset is used. First, the dataset is handled over Matlab/Octave due to its format. The extructures were managed and converted into matrises to an easy manipulation in Python.
